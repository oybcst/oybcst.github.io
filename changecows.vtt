00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:26.345

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.278
NC State is an AG school, and North Carolinians

5
00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.948
like to support their local farms.

6
00:00:32.948 --> 00:00:37.361
NC State is also home to your favorite Advanced Computing Specialist,

7
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:40.724
and she supports the high-performance computing center.

8
00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:45.702
In this project, she supports the hydrodynamics modeling for Mobile Bay.

9
00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:51.066


10
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.657
Raising a cow takes a lot of time and effort.

11
00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:56.913
It is expensive. And it takes a lot of space.

12
00:00:56.914 --> 00:00:58.026


13
00:00:58.026 --> 00:01:03.666
Our hydrodynamics model can take several weeks to run - even on a supercomputer!

14
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.053
Processing the resulting output

15
00:01:06.054 --> 00:01:08.129
can take several months.

16
00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:09.185


17
00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:13.417
The model generates 6TB of data.

18
00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:17.262
in other words, our data is a cow.

19
00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:19.311


20
00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:25.206


21
00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:28.136
A small farm can't afford to make any mistakes.

22
00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:30.418
Before they start raising the first cow,

23
00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:33.031
they need to know who their consumers will be.

24
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:34.800
Which products will they want?

25
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.526
And how do they need the products to be packaged?

26
00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:42.846
Likewise, before generating the next six terabytes of data,

27
00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:45.606
we need to know who the consumers will be.

28
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.886
Which products do they want?

29
00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:51.838
And how do they need the products to be packaged?

30
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.926
To get the cow ready for market,

31
00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.026
the processing must be done in a plant.

32
00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:03.606
This job is only done once.

33
00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:06.246
The cow goes in...

34
00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:09.806
and the products go out.

35
00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:12.185


36
00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.443
The data for our model needs to be processed on the supercomputer.

37
00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:20.165
Hopefully, this job is only done once.

38
00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.362
Ideally, the processing is done immediately.

39
00:02:23.363 --> 00:02:26.106
When the job finishes!

40
00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:29.586


41
00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:32.638
The data needs to be processed on the supercomputer.

42
00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.726
But we can't store it there. It will need to be archived.

43
00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:39.256
And we can't process data in that type of storage.

44
00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:42.426
If we don't have a list of the products needed when a model is finished,

45
00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:46.238
we end up moving the data back and forth.

46
00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:58.506


47
00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:02.607
We take great care to create models that get the science right.

48
00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:06.005
And to get things right, sometimes you need a cow.

49
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.287
We do need to pause, to think,

50
00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:11.465
and to make some data management decisions.

51
00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:12.786
Preferably...

52
00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:15.925
as soon as possible!
