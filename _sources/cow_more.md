Three cows are in a pasture. One is very close...and looking at you!

After the theme song from "Rawhide" plays, a sign plops down saying: and now for something completely different.

A "black and white silent-film" screen appears, saying: NC State is an Ag school...with supercomputing expertise.  

A family with NC State apparel pose next to two cows, then a pasture is shown along with several brand logos from local beef suppliers.

Next is a picture of NC State campus, the face of a smiling 'advanced computing specialist', and an image of a supercomputing cluster, followed by a short animation of bottom and surface salinity for Mobile Bay.

A "black and white silent-film" screen appears, saying: Raising a cow is hard work...and so is running our model.

A farmer nuzzles cow, a cartoon of cash and coins fall from the sky. A cowboy on a horse is herding cows over a wide open range 

The Mobile Bay hydrodynamics modeling grid is shown, with close-ups of areas with high resolution, with a supercomputer, and two smiling faces of people who process the data.  

We see an icon of a storage drive that has 6 TB.  Then, the cow who was looking at you, reappears apruptly.

A "black and white silent-film" screen appears, saying: How do small, family farms manage to deal with those cows??? ...and what can we learn from them?

A farmer is shown in contemplative state. Consumers are represented as box from suppliers or food delivery services. Products are shown by a diagram of a cow with areas labeled for the different cuts, and packaging is shown as individual steaks or patties.

A Mobile Bay model output and a supercomputer are shown. The consumers are climate, watershed, and ecology modelers. Products are quantities such as temperature, salinity, precipitation, and nutrients. Packaging are shown as file icons such as CSV and netCDF.

A "black and white silent-film" screen appears, saying: Limited Time Offer - Order Now!  ...we don't want to do this kind of job more than once! 

An animated cartoon cow walks in to picture of interior of meat processing plant.  Different cuts of beef moves out of the same plant.  There is a sketch of a customer with a menu and a waiter.  The customer asks "Can I just order a meatball?"

The animated cartoon cow walks in to picture of a supercomputer. The cow fades into the computational products, like temperature and salinity, and the packaging, CSV and netCDF files.

The animated cartoon cow starts behind a fence and walks into picture of a supercomputer, then the file icon image floats up from the supercomputer. The fence is labeled 'Cold Storage' and the supercomputer as 'Network Attached Storage'.  The cow moves back and forth between the fence and computer, and files float up from the computer when the cow moves behind it, a total of four times.  Text appears saying, "This is even more annoying in real life...And it's slower too!"

A "black and white silent-film" screen appears, saying: Don't moooove it twice...please let's discuss a plan for post-processing model results!

A cow is lying in a grassy field.  Three young women are sitting in the grass, next to the cow, one is cuddled close and gently holding the cow's face.  Next, a dozen cows in a feed lot. A farmer with a concerned face looks down at the cows, with hands on hips, as if wondering what to do.  Finally, a large herd of cows are being herded down a country road.  The image zooms in as to indicate a stampede.  

A "black and white silent-film" screen appears, saying: The End.  No cows were harmed in the making of this video.
