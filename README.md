## What are those files?

This repo has markdown files and config files that are 'compiled' into static html files and pushed to a github branch to publish the 
files on [oybcst.github.io](oybcst.github.io). 

It's not worth your time to dig through those files or to figure out how to do a pull request for the site. 

I would often click someone's 'GitHub' button on a site, or someone would send a link to a repo of their 'great site', and I get there 
and there is no README no intelligible files.  I wondered, how do they expect me to contribute to *this*???  Well...now I understand.

I'll add documentation on how I created this book soon.
