[Theme song from Rawhide]

2
00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:15.332


3
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:23.278


4
00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.212
NC State is an AG school, and North Carolinians

5
00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:29.881
like to support their local farms.

6
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.294
NC State is also home to your favorite Advanced Computing Specialist,

7
00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:37.658
and she supports the high-performance computing center.

8
00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.636
In this project, she supports the hydrodynamics modeling for Mobile Bay.

9
00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:42.732


10
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.000


11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.591
Raising a cow takes a lot of time and effort.

12
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:53.847
It is expensive. And it takes a lot of space.

13
00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:53.866


14
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:54.959


15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.600
Our hydrodynamics model can take several weeks to run - even on a supercomputer!

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.987
Processing the resulting output

17
00:01:02.987 --> 00:01:05.062
can take several months.

18
00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:05.066


19
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.118


20
00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.351
The model generates 6TB of data.

21
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:14.196
in other words, our data is a cow.

22
00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:14.232


23
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:22.139


24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.070
A small farm can't afford to make any mistakes.

25
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.352
Before they start raising the first cow,

26
00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:29.964
they need to know who their consumers will be.

27
00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:31.734
Which products will they want?

28
00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:35.459
And how do they need the products to be packaged?

29
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.779
Likewise, before generating the next six terabytes of data,

30
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.540
we need to know who the consumers will be.

31
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.820
Which products do they want?

32
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.772
And how do they need the products to be packaged?

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.860
To get the cow ready for market,

34
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.960
the processing must be done in a plant.

35
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.540
This job is only done once.

36
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.180
The cow goes in...

37
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.733
and the products go out.

38
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.119


39
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.377
The data for our model needs to be processed on the supercomputer.

40
00:02:13.377 --> 00:02:17.098
Hopefully, this job is only done once.

41
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.296
Ideally, the processing is done immediately.

42
00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:23.032
When the job finishes!

43
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.520


44
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.572
The data needs to be processed on the supercomputer.

45
00:02:29.572 --> 00:02:33.659
But we can't store it there. It will need to be archived.

46
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.190
And we can't process data in that type of storage.

47
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.359
If we don't have a list of the products needed when a model is finished,

48
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.166
we end up moving the data back and forth.

49
00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:55.439


50
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.541
We take great care to create models that get the science right.

51
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:02.939
And to get things right, sometimes you need a cow.

52
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.221
We do need to pause, to think,

53
00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:08.399
and to make some data management decisions.

54
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.720
Preferably...

55
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.859
as soon as possible!
