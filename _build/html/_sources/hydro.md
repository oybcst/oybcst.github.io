In the video:
- The starting screen is Google Earth, with a view from space showing the North America side of Earth.
- It zooms in to the Gulf of Mexico, then further zooms in to Mobile Bay.
- Borders, cities and road maps are turned on.
- The left half of the screen shows Mobile Bay on Google Earth, and the right half shows a model animation of temperature for the same area.
- On the left, the SCHISM grid is overlaid on Mobile Bay, while the animation on the right continues to play.
- Both images are zoomed in to the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta.
- The images on each size zoom to the location of Dauphin Island.
- There is a radial swipe to Dauphin Island with the SCHISM grid overlain, which further zooms to Dauphin Island Sea Lab(DISL).
- There is a frame flip to a Google Earth 3D map pedestrian view to the parking lot and entrance of DISL, showing signs for DISL and Alabama Aquarium. 
- The video does not have sound.
