[Theme song from Rawhide]

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.412


3
00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:21.345
NC State is an AG school, and North Carolinians

4
00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:25.015
like to support their local farms.

5
00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:29.428
NC State is also home to your favorite Advanced Computing Specialist,

6
00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.791
and she supports the high-performance computing center.

7
00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:37.769
In this project, she supports the hydrodynamics modeling for Mobile Bay.

8
00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:37.865


9
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:43.133


10
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.724
Raising a cow takes a lot of time and effort.

11
00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:48.980
It is expensive. And it takes a lot of space.

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.999


13
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:50.092


14
00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:55.733
Our hydrodynamics model can take several weeks to run - even on a supercomputer!

15
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.120
Processing the resulting output

16
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.195
can take several months.

17
00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:00.199


18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.252


19
00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:05.484
The model generates 6TB of data.

20
00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:09.329
in other words, our data is a cow.

21
00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:09.365


22
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:17.272


23
00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:20.203
A small farm can't afford to make any mistakes.

24
00:01:20.203 --> 00:01:22.485
Before they start raising the first cow,

25
00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:25.097
they need to know who their consumers will be.

26
00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:26.867
Which products will they want?

27
00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:30.593
And how do they need the products to be packaged?

28
00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:34.913
Likewise, before generating the next six terabytes of data,

29
00:01:34.913 --> 00:01:37.673
we need to know who the consumers will be.

30
00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:39.953
Which products do they want?

31
00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:43.905
And how do they need the products to be packaged?

32
00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.993
To get the cow ready for market,

33
00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:53.093
the processing must be done in a plant.

34
00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:55.673
This job is only done once.

35
00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:58.313
The cow goes in...

36
00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:01.866
and the products go out.

37
00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:04.252


38
00:02:04.252 --> 00:02:08.510
The data for our model needs to be processed on the supercomputer.

39
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.231
Hopefully, this job is only done once.

40
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.429
Ideally, the processing is done immediately.

41
00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.165
When the job finishes!

42
00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:21.653


43
00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:24.705
The data needs to be processed on the supercomputer.

44
00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:28.792
But we can't store it there. It will need to be archived.

45
00:02:28.793 --> 00:02:31.323
And we can't process data in that type of storage.

46
00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:34.492
If we don't have a list of the products needed when a model is finished,

47
00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:38.299
we end up moving the data back and forth.

48
00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:50.572


49
00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:54.674
We take great care to create models that get the science right.

50
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.072
And to get things right, sometimes you need a cow.

51
00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:00.354
We do need to pause, to think,

52
00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:03.532
and to make some data management decisions.

53
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:04.853
Preferably...

54
00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:07.992
as soon as possible!
