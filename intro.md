# Oysters, Blue Crabs, and Spotted Seatrout

***Building Resilience to Environmental Trends and Variability in the Gulf of Mexico***

OyBcSt examines how oyster, blue crab, and spotted seatrout populations respond to human and environmental changes with the goal of improving the management of these economically and culturally important species.

## Hydrodynamics
A hydrodynamics model calculates sea surface height, water temperature, salinity, and currents. Observations of these physical quantities may only be available for a handful of locations and times, but our model can fill in the gaps, giving us useful data for each point in space and time in the model domain.

## Thank you NOAA and NSF

The hydrodynamics modeling work is a component of research funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's RESTORE Science Program under award NA19NOS4510194 to University of South Alabama and North Carolina State University.

The hydrodynamics modeling for this project is done on Expanse, at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), and the modeling data is being hosted on Open Storage Network (OSN), through allocation EES210015 from the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support, which is supported by National Science Foundation grants #2138259, #2138286, #2138307, #2137603, and #2138296.

Work at both providers was done under the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which was supported by National Science Foundation grant number #1548562. We thank Mark W. Van Moer of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCAR) for advanced visualization support which was made possible through the XSEDE Extended Collaborative Support Service (ECSS) program.
